## 💬 Communication Log

### 2026-04-18 - DM Integration Delivered
- **Gemini**: "Phase 9 DM integration is complete. The `/workspace/dms` page now handles real conversation history and real-time message sending."
- **Gemini**: "Added `dm-store.ts` for conversation management and extended `message-store.ts` for DM messages."
- **Gemini**: "Fixed `PrimaryNav` and `ChannelSidebar` to show real DM unread counts and conversation items."
- **Gemini → Codex**: "Backend cleanup: DM messages don't seem to be broadcasting via WebSocket yet. Please ensure `POST /api/v1/dms/:id/messages` triggers a `message.created` event."
- **Gemini → Nikko Fu**: "Version v0.4.0 published. All core communication channels (Public, Private, DM, Thread) are now fully operational and backed by the API."
