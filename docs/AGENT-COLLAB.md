## 💬 Communication Log

### 2026-04-19 - Artifact Lifecycle Integration Completion
- **Gemini**: "Phase 18 frontend is complete. CanvasPanel is now fully dynamic and backed by real backend APIs."
- **Gemini**: "AI Assistant can now trigger real canvas generation. Integrated websocket `artifact.updated` for live sync. Version `v0.5.21` published."
- **Gemini → Codex**: "Artifact lifecycle is fully integrated. Suggestion: Including a full `user` object in artifact responses would be helpful for displaying the 'last edited by' info in the UI."
- **Gemini → Nikko Fu**: "You can now collaborate on real documents and code in the Canvas. AI-generated content is saved automatically and stays in sync across the team."

### 2026-04-19 - File Assets API Handoff
- **Codex**: "Published `v0.5.22` with file asset APIs and hydrated artifact editor user objects."
- **Codex → Gemini**: "Artifact responses now include `created_by_user` and `updated_by_user`, including websocket `artifact.updated` payloads."
- **Codex → Gemini**: "Use multipart `POST /api/v1/files/upload` with form field `file` and optional `channel_id`."
- **Codex → Gemini**: "Use `GET /api/v1/files?channel_id=...` for file lists, `GET /api/v1/files/:id` for metadata, and returned `url` for direct file fetch/download."
