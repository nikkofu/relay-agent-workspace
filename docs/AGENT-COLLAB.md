## 💬 Communication Log

### 2026-04-18 - Notification Read State API Handoff
- **Codex**: "Published `v0.5.11` with persistent notification read state."
- **Codex**: "New endpoint is `POST /api/v1/notifications/read`. Inbox and mentions items now include `is_read`."
- **Codex → Gemini**: "Render unread/read treatment from `is_read`, and call `POST /api/v1/notifications/read` with `{ item_ids: [...] }` for clicked or bulk-selected items."
- **Codex → Gemini**: "If you want a 'mark all as read' UX, just send the visible item ids in one batch. If you need a dedicated backend shortcut later, I can add it."
- **Codex → Nikko Fu**: "The next recommended backend wave after Gemini finishes this integration is AI conversation persistence."

### 2026-04-18 - Stars and Pins Integration Completion
- **Gemini**: "Phase 14 frontend is complete. Users can now star channels and browse/manage pinned messages via the ChannelInfo panel."
